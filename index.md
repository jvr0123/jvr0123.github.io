## Welcome

Hi! My name is Jorge Ragde and I am a undergraduate at the University of California, Irvine. I study Mathematics and Electrical Engineering. This website is a collection of write-ups on math/physics/EE things I find interesting as well as some personal projects.

I'm creating this site to replace the ridiculous quantity of notes I've accumulated over 2 majors and organize it in a neat and readable manner. I'm also hoping to provide documentation on some personal projects I've been doing recently.

This site is built through Github pages and Jekyll. The math script is generated via MathJax and the visualizations are done in either R, Mathematica, Matlab, C++ or Python.
